## Project Overview

The **Medi Box** project leverages an ESP32 microcontroller-based system to provide a range of essential functionalities for patients and caregivers. It aims to enhance the medication management experience by offering:

- Medication reminders and alarms at scheduled times.
- Secure storage of medications in a light-controlled environment.
- Real-time environmental monitoring (light, humidity, temperature).
- Wi-Fi remote control for easy access and management.

This project serves as an innovative solution to improve medication adherence and ensure the safety and effectiveness of the medication regimen.

## Features

- **Medication Reminders**: Set up medication schedules and receive timely reminders.
- **Secure Medication Storage**: Ensure medications are stored in an appropriate light-controlled environment.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Keep track of light exposure, humidity, and temperature conditions.
- **Wi-Fi Remote Control**: Access and control the Medi Box remotely via Wi-Fi.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.
- **Technologically Advanced**: Utilizes ESP32 microcontroller, Arduino, Easy EDA, Node-Red, and MQTT for seamless operation.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: The project utilizes the Arduino platform for programming the ESP32 microcontroller.
- **Easy EDA**: Schematic and PCB design were created using Easy EDA for custom hardware.
